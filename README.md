WWF colour palette
==================

Our colour palette offers 11 main colours and three tonal options, a dark, medium and light tone.

Tints of these colours are possible but legibility is paramount when using lighter tones for typography, or when using type reversed out of a tint.

Available as both hexidecimal and rgba. Hexidecimal has the higher level of browser support, but rgba allows for alpha-transparency.
